# Sea Level Predictor 🌊📈

Data Analysis & Forecasting: Predicting Global Sea Level Rise (1880–2050)

📌 Project Overview

Dive into the rising tide of climate change with Sea Level Predictor – a data science journey that transforms 134 years of global sea level measurements (1880–2014) into crystal-clear forecasts through 2050. Using the precision of statistical linear regression, this project doesn't just analyze data – it unveils the ocean's urgent story, revealing accelerating trends that demand attention.

From scattered historical data points to publication-ready visualizations, witness how Python, Pandas, and SciPy turn raw climate observations into actionable insights about our planet's future. This isn't just code – it's data-driven climate storytelling at its most compelling.
